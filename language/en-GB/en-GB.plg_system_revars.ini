PLG_REVARS_XML_DESCRIPTION="Variables for the site and absolutely replaceable text. <br /> Variables can be used on the site like all jumla plugins in this way: {VAR_NAME}, where NAME is the name of the variable. This is the name you need to specify in the table. Variable names must be written in large letters (in upper case). <br /> <br /> System variables that can be used in your variables: <br /> {VAR_SERVER_NAME} - The name of the host on which the current script is running, for example, www.site.ru. This name is taken from the server settings and does not depend on the request address. <br /> {VAR_HTTP_HOST} - Content Host header: from the current request, if there is one. For example, site.ru. This content is taken from the browser request and depends on it. If someone typed www.site.ru instead of site.ru you will get exactly www.site .ru <br /> {VAR_REQUEST_URI} - The URI that was provided to access this page. For example, '/index.html'. <br /> {VAR_REMOTE_ADDR} - IP address from which the user is viewing the current page., "
