PLG_REVARS_XML_DESCRIPTION="Shortcodes, Language Constant and variables for the site. <br /> Variables can be used on the site like all joomla plugins in this way: {VAR_NAME}, where NAME is the variable name. <br /><br />System variables you can use in your variables:<br /> {VAR_SERVER_NAME} - The name of the host where the current script is running. For example, www.site.ru. This name is taken from the server settings and doesn't depend on the request address. <br /> {VAR_HTTP_HOST} - Content of the Host header: from the current request, if there is one.  For example, site.ru. This content is taken from the request browser and depends on it. If someone typed www.site.ru instead of site.ru you will get exactly www.site.ru <br /> {VAR_REQUEST_URI} - The URI that was provided to access this page. For example '/index.html'. <br /> {VAR_REMOTE_ADDR} - The IP address from which the user is viewing the current page."
